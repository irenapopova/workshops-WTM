## Learning to Code Opens up the Mind

Programming Concepts: Introduction for Absolute Beginners

## Workshop Description

This workshop is designed as an introduction for anyone looking to gain a basic understanding of computer programming and programming concepts.

For starters, you’ll learn the most common Command Line Interface and Operating System commands for both Windows- and Linux-based computers.

You’ll then move on to explore the structure of a simple computer program, identifying the purpose of each part. You’ll examine variables, and you’ll dive into the role of functions.

You’ll then become familiar with the design process behind writing a computer program. You’ll explore program flow, decision making, and looping. Moving on, you’ll examine how algorithms and flowcharts are used in computer program design, and you’ll examine the three programming concepts of sequence, selection, and repetition.

The Web has become an integral part of everyday lives and it plays a crucial role in modern college education. A better understanding of the basics of web development is a stepping-stone for participants looking to further dive into professional web development and it also provides invaluable insights to everyday web users. This workshop series provides an overview of the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, which are the building blocks of the Web. It will also provide an introduction to libraries, frameworks, APIs, giving the participants an opportunity to further expand their capabilities. The participants will learn how websites are made: designing layouts, adding content, manipulating styles, and implementing interactive features. By the end of the workshop series, all participants will have their own unique website that is accessible to the world, and they will have the skills and resources to build a more complex website on their own.

As you progress through the workshops, you’ll learn the most common best practices for designing and developing software documentation. And you’ll learn best practices for writing and documenting your source code.

Finally, you’ll learn best practice for implementing security within your applications. And you’ll learn how to test and debug your code to eliminate potential errors.

## Aim / Zielstellung

This WORKSHOP is aimed at those new to programming, or who have never been formally taught the principles and basic concepts of programming.

It provides an introduction to the basic concepts common to most high level languages (including html, css, javascript). The aim  is to equip attendees with the background knowledge and confidence necessary to tackle many on-line and printed programming tutorials. It may also help attendees in deciding which programming language is suitable for their programming task. Making a website from scratch for absolute beginners

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop series, participants will

* Have a clear understanding of client-side web development
* Be able to find and learn libraries suitable for specific tasks
* Be able to identify and use the right frameworks depending on the needs
* Be able to choose an API and learn its usage from documentations
* Have a basic understanding of server-side web development
* Have a unique website hosted on GitHub
* Be empowered with infinite resources online to further develop their skills in web development on their own

## Teaching Methodology / Methoden

Learning by doing. This workshop series embraces an example-based learning process. The participants will be given code examples that slowly guide them as the workshop progresses. It also focuses on learning by practicing. The participants will be assigned homework that motivates them to branch out and learn on their own. The participants will be encouraged to come up with creative solutions of their own, instead of rigidly following the path of the old-timers.
